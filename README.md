This plugin adds a function to make the [fish-shell](http://fish.sh) ASCII-art logo speak! It's completely ridiculous and unnecessary, but was a fun project for learning to write code for fish. I've used bash and zsh for a few decades, but have only been using fish for a few weeks, so I'm sure there's much in this code that should be improved.

## 🔎 Examples
**Pipe text to fish_say**
```fish
fortune | fish_say
```
**Get text from the command line**
```fish
fish_say "Hi, I'm a talking fish"
```
**Multiline**
```fish
fish_say 'line 1' 'line 2' 'line 3'
```
**Change Appearance**

```fish
fish_say -o white -m brblack -i white --mouth=O --eye=X "I'm dead jim"
```
**Save Configuration**
```fish
fish_say -o blue -m cyan -i green -b yellow -t white --save
```

**Delete Configuration**
```fish
fish_say --delete
```

**Add to fish_greeting**
You can enjoy this foolishness every time the shell loads by adding this to your fish greeting (`~/.config/fish/functions/fish_greeting.fish`):

```fish
    function fish_greeting
        fortune | fish_say
    end
```

- 🐠 [fish_logo](https://github.com/laughedelic/fish_logo): original inspiration and I stole the fish graphic from here as well.
- 🐮 [cowsay](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay): The fortune command isn't nearly as much fun when it isn't piped through cowsay and lolcat.
- 🌈 [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat): Rainbow goodness
